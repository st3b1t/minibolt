# 1.4 Configuration

You are now on the command line of your own Bitcoin node. Let's start with the configuration.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/configuration.jpg" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Add the admin user (and log in with it)

We will use the primary user `admin` instead of `temp` to make this guide more universal.

* Create a new user called `admin` with your `password [A]`

```sh
$ sudo adduser --gecos "" admin
```

* Make this new user a superuser by adding it to the `sudo` and old `temp` user groups

```sh
$ sudo usermod -a -G sudo,adm,cdrom,dip,plugdev,lxd admin
```

* Logout the existing `temp` user

```sh
$ logout
```

* Repeat [Access with Secure Shell](remote-access.md#access-with-secure-shell) but this time login with `admin` and your `password [A]`
* Delete the `temp` user. Do not worry about the `userdel: temp mail spool (/var/mail/temp) not found` message

```sh
$ sudo userdel -rf temp
```

Expected output:

```
> userdel: temp mail spool (/var/mail/temp) not found
```

{% hint style="info" %}
To change the system configuration and files that don't belong to the user "admin", you have to prefix commands with `sudo`. You will be prompted to enter your admin `password [A]` from time to time for increased security
{% endhint %}

## Login with SSH keys (optional)

{% hint style="info" %}
Now, you can start to access it without a password by following the [SSH keys bonus guide](../bonus/system/ssh-keys.md)
{% endhint %}

## System update

* Update the operating system and all installed software packages

```sh
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Do this regularly every few months for security-related updates. If during the update process, a banner appears asking you, "Which services should be restarted?" you can press ENTER and take note of the services that will be restarted, marked with `[*]`. Example ðŸ”½
{% endhint %}

![](../images/update-action.PNG)

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended to keep the default selection and restart all marked items. However, if you want to unmark any of them, select the item and press the **spacebar to toggle the mark**. Finally, press `ENTER` to confirm
{% endhint %}

* To be able to use the `minibolt` hostname instead of the IP address, we must install this necessary software package

```sh
$ sudo apt install avahi-daemon
```

## Check drive performance

Performant unit storage is essential for your node.

Let's check if your drive works well as-is.

* Your disk should be detected as `/dev/sda`. Check if this is the case by listing the names of connected block devices

```sh
$ lsblk -pli
```

* Measure the speed of your drive

```sh
$ sudo hdparm -t --direct /dev/sda
```

**Example** of expected output:

```
> Timing O_DIRECT disk reads: 932 MB in 3.00 seconds = 310.23 MB/sec
```

{% hint style="success" %}
If the measured speeds are more than 150 MB/s, you're good
{% endhint %}

* If you installed a **secondary disk**, check and measure the speed with the next command, if not, skip it

```sh
$ sudo hdparm -t --direct /dev/sdb
```

**Example** of expected output:

```
> Timing O_DIRECT disk reads: 932 MB in 3.00 seconds = 310.23 MB/sec
```

{% hint style="success" %}
If the measured speeds are more than 100 MB/s, you're good but is recommended more for a better experience
{% endhint %}

## Data directory

We'll store all application data in the dedicated directory `/data`. This allows for better security because it's not inside any user's home directory. Additionally, it's easier to move that directory somewhere else, for instance to a separate drive, as you can just mount any storage option to `/data`.

* Create the data folder

```sh
$ sudo mkdir /data
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember that the before command is not necessary if you previously followed [Case 1](../bonus/system/store-data-secondary-disk.md#case-1-during-the-ubuntu-server-guided-installation) of [Store data in a secondary disk](../bonus/system/store-data-secondary-disk.md) bonus guide, which involves storing the data in a secondary disk. This is because the **("data")** folder has already been created. If the prompt shows you: `mkdir: cannot create directory '/data': File exists` probably is that. Then ignore it and follow with the next command ðŸ”½
{% endhint %}

* Assing to the `admin` user as the owner of the **`(/data)`** folder

```sh
$ sudo chown admin:admin /data
```
